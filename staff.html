			 <h2>Olga and Bruce McKenzie</h2><p>Fly To The Limit was started by a husband and wife team, Olga and Bruce McKenzie who, together have over 20 years respectively flying for the Middle eastern airlines. We offer tourists a range of scenic flights in both fixed wing and helicopters, as well as high adventure in a stunt plane, or the most peaceful flight experience possible in a glider high above the mountains. We also specialise in one-off charters and delivery and pick up for trampers, also providing a provisioning service for fresh supplies during the long excursions.

			<h2>Finn McCool</h2> <p>Stunt pilot with the Red Arrowa (UK airforce stunt team), has served in combat choppers in 3 recent wars, and fears nothing except small dogs and single women. Owns an Extra EA-200 for the ultimate full stunt flight experience, and flies all our other fixed wing craft much more sedately when requires. And, yes, that is his real name. He's Irish and he doesn't want to talk about it.

			<h2>Hans Gerhansen</h2> <p>Hanshas flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a small plane at 12 Years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After a few years flying "anything, anywhere" he settles into a series of test pilot jobs, but left that because he prefers company when he's in the air.

			Hans doesn't actually own his own plane right now, unless you count the microlight, but you will find him in the pilot's seat of any of our air crafts. When he's not skiing, tramping, climbing, hang gliding, or performing with his back up band at a local hotel.
